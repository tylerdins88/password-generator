# Password-Generator

## Description

I have created a random password generator webpage. When a user visits this page, there is a button to click to generate a password. Once clicked, they are prompted with a serious of questions to create the password. First they are asked to select a length between 8-128. Then they are asked four questions which include; Would you like to use lowercase letters, would you like to include uppercase letters, would you like to include numbers, and would you like to include special characters?

I was motivated to build this webpage to help make passwords for the numerous logins that I have. By using this site, it helps create a more secure password that can not be simply identified. Building this helped me learn many different features within javascript. 

First I used a prompt method to verify the characters a user would like.

I also used confirm method to ask what criteria a user would like to include in the password.

Then I created a for loop to make the password using the amount of characters a user chose as well as the criteria that they wished for the password to include.

Lastly, I used a if statement to check that the password that was created includes all criteria required by the user.
